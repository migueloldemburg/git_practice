## Reseting Files

> git checkout HEAD file_name | git checkout -- file_name

Restores the file in your Working Directory to look exactly as it did when you last made a commit. Discards changes in the Working Directory

> git reset HEAD file_name

Resets the file in the Staging Area to be the same as the HEAD commit. It does not discard file changes from the Working Directory, it just removes them from the Staging Area

> git reset commit_SHA

Resets to a previous commit, using the first 7 characters of one of the past commit *SHAs* in your Git log. The **HEAD** commit has been reassigned. You just changed history! HEAD goes to a previously made commit of your choice. Commits after that are no longer part of your project
