# Getting Started...

## After creating our Laravel Project with:
> *composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel blog "5.4.*"*

And start our Local Server
> php artisan serve

##We can now start working on our project files.

Let's modify the .ENV file to give access to the DB
> Type in the correct DB credentials

Migrate it with:
> php artisan migrate
*This command generates three new tables on DB and hook it up with the project*
